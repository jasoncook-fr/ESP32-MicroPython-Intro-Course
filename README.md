### Install Firmware onto the ESP32

1. **Download the Necessary Firmware** <br />
Visit the [download page](https://micropython.org/download/) of the official micropython website. <br />
You will notice there are many options. For most generic ESP32 devices the following firmware profile should be fine: [HERE](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)

2. **Download esptool software** <br />
I recommend using the latest version available [HERE](https://github.com/espressif/esptool)

3. Connect the ESP32 to your computer with a micro-USB cable.

4. The Raspberry Pico will appear as a USB storage device on your computer.
